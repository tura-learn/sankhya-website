            None of this is for want of law. The record already says what happened and what must happen next. It is
            spread across portals, PDFs and people&rsquo;s memories, and nobody has the time to read all of it every
            morning.
          </p>
          <p>
            So we built Manu to read it: every case, every morning, with the exact words on every line. It decides
            nothing. It makes sure that the people who do decide, on either side of the bar and on the bench, are
            reading the same page.
